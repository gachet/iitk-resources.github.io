The course content is divided into two parts. The first half consists of Organic Chemistry concepts, many of which are repititions of those that we studied during our JEE preparation. The second half consists of Physical Chemistry.

The course content is very straight-forward and easy. A little amount of time per week on a regular basis can do the work. There are some conventions and definitions to be understood (not rememebered) and the most important and the only major topic is the Laplace Transform. Till Midsem, analog signals are covered while after midsem, digitals signals are taught but all concepts taught in the second half are almost same as the first half, the only difference being that they are applied on digital/discrete signals instead of analog signals.</description></item><item><title>EE210A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee210a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee210a/</guid><description>This course is a DC course, to be done in the 4th semester by the Electrical Engineering branch.
This course is the first course which will give you the feeling of what a specialisation in core electrical might look like. The course content includes discussions on diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs in the beginning, and then the complex structures, like amplifiers and output stages, are presented to you. Amplifier is the most element so make sure that you understand its properties.</description></item><item><title>EE250A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee250a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee250a/</guid><description>This course is a DC course, to be done in the 4th semester by the Electrical Engineering branch.
This course introduces you to a specific field of core electrical engineering, namely control systems, which have profound usgae in almost all controlled machinery like robotics. This course is somparatively easy than other core courses. Laplace transform, taught in EE200, is the only mathematical tool used for almost all tasks.

This is one of those courses which should spark the interest in you towards the Electrical Engineerinb branch. It is also a very important course w.r.t to your involvement in core opportunities, be it projects, internships or placements.
The course has three parts. The first part consists of the basics and fundamentals of current electricity like KVL, KCL, RLC circuits, etc.</description></item><item><title>ESO203A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/eso203a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/eso203a/</guid><description>This course is a DC course for Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering students.
The objective of this course is to introduce us to power systems and electrical engineering behind power transmission. The first is focused on revising basic electrical concepts like KVL, KCL, etc. The second half introduces transformers, motors and generators (both DC and AC) with a tonne of calculations.
